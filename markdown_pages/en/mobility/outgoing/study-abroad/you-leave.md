## What do I have to do before I leave?

### 1\. Request a place

Before requesting a mobility place, make sure you meet the requirements to
participate.

Check the calls to the various mobility programmes in the [mobility
calendar](en/mobility/outgoing/mobility-calendar.md) to know what the
procedure to request a place is and all the relevant information.

To do the **place assignment** , requesting students will be ranked taking
into account the mean grade and the alpha performance parameter of the last
two semesters. Mobility places will be assigned in this order according to the
preferences stated in your petition and depending on the place availability.

The resolution will be communicated via e-mail.

### 2\. Accept the place

Once you get assigned the mobility place, you will have to accept it through
the [e-Secretaria](estudiants.md) (obviously only if you have requested it
through the e-Secretaria). Failure to accept before the deadline will imply
the resignation of the mobility place.

### 3\. Find the procedure at the host university

Check the website of the host university, find the _Exchange_ or _Incoming
Students_ sections and prepare all the required documentation for the academic
exchange. If you do not find it, get in touch with the International Relations
Area of the destination university and ask what you have to do.

### 4\. Fill in the application form

Fill in the application form of the destination university. You have to send
it in before a deadline, which is different for every university.

If you are asked for a transcript of records, send an email to the FIB
secretariat requesting an ECTS certificate in English or Spanish depending on
the destination.

### 5\. Complete the learning agreement

Check the host university's website what subjects they offer to exchange
students. When you have the list of possible subjects to take, you will have
to meet with the Vice-dean for International Relations to fill in the learning
agreement. It is usually sent together with the application form and the rest
of the required documents.

  * Learning Agreement for the Erasmus+ programme (this process is done through the e-secretaria)
  * [Learning Agreement](sites/fib/files/documents/la_erasmus_tnap.docx.md) for Stays in Erasmus+ TPNAP Destinations ([Third Countries Not Associated with the Program](sga/ca/Beques/BequesMobilitat/1aconvoc_sms_ka131_tpnap_24-25_folder/TercersPaisosNoAssociatsPrograma.md))

In the case of the FIB, the universities which have signed the Erasmus+ KA131
TPNAP agreement and which can therefore be stays with the possibility of
scholarship are the followings:

\- Federal University of Sao Carlos (Brazil)

\- University of Edinburgh (United Kingdom)

\- University of Coventry (United Kingdom)

\- National Taiwan University of Science and Technology - TAIWANTECH (Taiwan)

\- Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile (Chile)

\- Universidad de Montevideo (Uruguay)

\- City University of Hong Kong (China)

\- Beijing Institute of Technology (China)

  * [Learning Agreement](sites/fib/files/documents/learningagreement_en_no_erasmus_2023.docx.md) for stays outside the Erasmus+ programme

If you take **courses** :

  * If you want academic recognition for your mobility, all subjects will **need to have** the authorization of the Vice-dean for International Relations **before** you send the documentation to the host university.
  * **Compulsory or already taken subjects will NEVER be recognised.**
  * To do specialization complementary courses, you will need the approval of the specialization coordinator, who will have to sign the relevant document.

Bachelor: [Specialization complementary subject
approval](sites/fib/files/documents/mobilitat/autoritzacio_complement_especialitat_mobilitat_cast.pdf.md)

Master: [Specialization ](sites/fib/files/documents/mobilitat/master-
approval_subjects_specialization.pdf.md)[complementary subject
approval](sites/fib/files/documents/mobilitat/master-
approval_subjects_specialization.pdf.md)

If you have to do the **TFG** or **TFM** :

  * For both the TFG and TFM you will need the approval of the specialization coordinator, who will have to sign the relevant document.

[TFG mobility
approval](sites/fib/files/documents/autoritzacio_tfg_mobilitat_esp.docx.md)

[TFM mobility
approval](sites/fib/files/documents/mobilitat/autoritzacio_tfm_mobilitat_eng.pdf.md)

  * It is better to try to find a director from Barcelona via the mobility coordinator of the host institution.
  * The thesis will be presented there according to the rules of the host university. FIB only need the original transcript of records in which the grade obtained and number of credits have to appear. You will also have to upload the report to the [Racó](index.md).

If you are requested a transcript of records, you can ask it for free via the
e-Secretaria. You should request the ECTS certificate in English.

### 6\. Hand in the acceptance letter

Once you send the application form with the required documentation, you have
to wait for the host university to resolve it. If you are accepted, you will
be notified with an acceptance letter. You will have to upload it to your
e-Secretaria. Check that there are indicated the planned beginning and ending
dates.

From there, we will be able to issue your mobility credential depending on the
type of mobility programme.

### 7\. Hand in the financial agreement at FIB (only for European destinations
of the Erasmus+ programme)

Through the e-Secretariat, when available, you will be able to access the
financial agreement that you will have to sign through the signature holder
with the UPC card. The financial agreement is the document associated to the
Erasmus+ grant. Normally, this document is made available during the mobility
stay. You will receive an email when it is available for signature by the UPC
signature holder. Once signed by you and the Vice-Dean of International
Relations, it will be automatically validated in the e-secretariat.

### 8\. Hand in the Erasmus+ grant request (if relevant)

In the period in which the Erasmus+ scholarship call is opened you will
receive an email with information. It is not necessary to apply. If you have
been assigned a mobility and you have the required documentation, at any time,
uploaded to the e-secretariat you will be considered eligible for the grant.

### 9\. Hand in the SEPA mandate (for mobilities with a grant)

Those students that apply for a grant must:

**1\. Inform of a bank account to receive the grant.**  
-This is a specific account for the mobility grant.  
-The account must belong to the student.  
-The student must enter the e-secretaria: Mobility/Mobility Stay/General data/bank data (illustrative path) and add the account.

**2\. Have a valid SEPA mandate.**  
-This SEPA mandate is the same for the enrolment (not especific for the mobility)  
-If you already have it, there is no need to do anything else.  
-In case you do not have it, or that it is not valid anymore, you must enter your e-secretaria: My data/bank acounts/Bank acount linked to SEPA mandate (illustrative path), add your data, sign and save the document.  
-The account does not need to belong to the student.

### Documents linked to your mobility stay:

  * Acceptance letter (e-Secretaria). When it is already signed by the 3 parties. For stays within the Erasmus+ programme the LA is automatically validated and uploaded to the e-secretariat once it is validated by the 3 parties.
  * The authorizations of the specialization coordinator, if needed, for complementary subjects of your specialization and/or mobility TFG/TFM
  * A photocopy of your European Health Card
  * Financial agreement, for European destinations of the Erasmus+ programme (original)
  * Mobility credential, for stays in Switzerland or non-European destinations. This document will be issued by us for you to sign it and take a copy with you.
  * SEPA mandate, if needed.

**It is essential that you upload the required documentation in the
e-Secretaria before you leave.**

### 10\. Do the language test (only for stays within the framework of the
erasmus + program)

Before the start of your stay you should do the language test. It is highly
recommended that you take the exam on the OLS platform and access the online
courses that interest you, although it is not mandatory to present proof that
you have taken the language test.

Click on this [link](sga/ca/Beques/BequesMobilitat/OLS.md) to see all the
information about how to do it.

### 11\. Check the enrolment pre-compromise

According to your academic record and learning agreement previously agreed
upon, your **enrolment pre-compromise** will be generated. You have to check
it through the [e-Secretaria](estudiants.md) before you enrol. You should
communicate any errors you find because it will be used to prepare your real
mobility enrolment.

### 12\. Enrol at FIB

You have to enrol the day and hour you are assigned via the e-Secretaria.
Remember that you only pay enrolment at FIB and not at your destination
university. [Conditions](es/estudios/secretaria/tramites/matricula-
outgoing.md)

A [compulsory insurance](sri/ca/mobilitat/mobilitat-estudiants/asseguranca-
obligatoria.md) payment will be included in the price of the enrolment. The
insurance will cover the whole period of the mobility stay. When formalizing
the enrollment, the certificate of coverage and contact information in case of
emergency will be available for the student in the mobility documentation
section of the e-Secretaria

At the UPC Mobility Office (Telecom square), they will inform you about:

  * Medical coverage/Social Security
  * Visas/Legal status
