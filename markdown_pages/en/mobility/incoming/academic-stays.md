  * [Research Visit](en/mobility/incoming/research-visit.md)

If you want to come study at the Facultat d'Informàtica de Barcelona as an
**exchange student** , you have to take the following steps:

  1. [Check if there is an agreement](en/mobility/incoming/academic-stays.md)
  2. [Get nominated by your university](en/mobility/incoming/academic-stays.md)
  3. [Wait until receive an e-mail with information to register](en/mobility/incoming/academic-stays.md)
  4. [Certify your language level](en/mobility/incoming/academic-stays.md)
  5. [Prepare the Learning Agreement](en/mobility/incoming/academic-stays.md)
  6. [Upload the required documentation to the platfom application](en/mobility/incoming/academic-stays.md)
  7. [Application to be validated](en/mobility/incoming/academic-stays.md)

  9. [Register in the reception programmes](en/mobility/incoming/academic-stays.md)
  10. [Enrol](en/mobility/incoming/academic-stays.md)

### 1\. Check if there is an agreement

Make sure there is a signed bilateral agreement between your university and
FIB; you can consult the [partner universities](en/mobility/international-
partnerships/partner-universities.md) and [mobility
programs](en/mobility/international-partnerships/mobility-programs.md).

### 2\. Get nominated by your university

In order to come to Barcelona School of Informatics (FIB) as an exchange
student, you first have to be nominated by your university.

The nomination procedure will be sent to all partner institutions via e-mail
by mid-March and early October. For any doubt or information regarding the
procedure related to the nomination, your university can contact to

**Nomination Deadlines**

  * 1st semester and full academic year students: **2 May**
  * 2nd semester students:**2 November**

### 3\. Wait until receive an e-mail with information to register

Once you have been nominated by your university you will receive an e-mail
with the information and the deadline to fill out your online application form
through the FIB Mobility students tool.

**Application Deadlines**

  * 1st semester and full academic year students: **1 June**
  * 2nd semester students:**1 December**

### 4\. Certify your language level

Barcelona is the main city of Catalonia, a bilingual community, so both
Catalan and Spanish are oficial languages of UPC. As a mobility student you
should have, at least, an intermediate level (B1) of the language of
instruction of the degree you will enrol in. This language is:

  * Bachelor's degree in Informatics Engineering - GEI: Spanish/Catalan
  * Bachelor's degree in Data Science and Engineering - GCED: Spanish/Catalan
  * Master's degree in Informatics Engineering - MEI: Spanish/Catalan
  * Master's degree in Innovation and Research in Informatics - MIRI: English
  * Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence - MAI: English
  * Master's degree in Data Science - MDS: English

If the language of instruction is not your native language, you will have to
submit a certificate of proficiency.

For **English** , level B1 can be certified by any of the most common
certificates: TOEFL, IELTS, TOEIC (4 skills), FCE, DAAD exam, ...

Check the [UPC accepted English certificates
table](slt/ca/certifica/taulacertificats.md) (information only in Catalan
version)

For **Spanish** , level B1 can be certified by:

  * The “[Diploma de Español como Lengua Extranjera](informacion/niveles/nivel_b1.html.md) ([DELE](index.md))”, granted by the [Instituto Cervantes](default.htm.md).
  * A [SIELE Global](web/guest/siele-global.md) certificate, granted by the SIELE institution, with a score at least equivalent to the B1 level of the CEFR.

For **Catalan** , level B1 can be certified by the [Certificat de Nivell
Elemental](catala/aprendre_catala/certificats_examens_elemental.cfm.md),
granted by the [Institut Ramon Llull](index.md).

**In any case, you will also be able to certify level B1 with an equivalent
certificate obtained at your university**.

### 5\. Prepare the Learning Agreement

The Learning Agreement is the document in which you state the subjects you
will take during your mobility stay. It has to be agreed by you, your
university and us. On our side, the list of subjects included in the
application form is equivalent to the Learning Agreement. In any case,
depending on the programme you are doing your mobility in, you may have to
fill in a specific document. Ask your university to get the information.

See the [COURSE CATALOGUE](course_catalogue.md) (available subjects for
exchange students)

  * There are dependencies between subjects, so take into account the academic requirements for each subject. You will have to attach a Transcript of Records so we can check that you meet them.
  * All the courses have a limited number of places offered to exchange students. The places will be assigned following the order of **completion** of the application procedure.

  * The learning agreement for the **spring semester** of the students coming for the **full academic year** can be modified according to the performance attained in the **autumn semester** , according to the same regulations applied to degree students.

  * Master's students are allowed to take courses from different degrees as long as they meet the academic and language requirements.
  * You can enrol in a maximum of 30 ECTS per a semester.
  * If you are interested in doing your bachelor's or master's thesis at FIB, you will have to choose between 18 ECTS for the bachelor or 18 or 30 ECTS for the masters. 
    * [Information on the GEI bachelor's degree's final thesis - 18 ECTS](en/studies/bachelors-degrees/informatics-engineering/degree-final-project.md)
    * [Information on the GCED bachelor's degree's final thesis - 18 ECTS](en/undergraduate-students/degree-final-project-tfg.md)
    * [Information on the MEI master's thesis - 30 ECTS](en/studies/masters/master-informatics-engineering/masters-thesis.md)
    * [Information on the MIRI master's thesis - 30 ECTS](en/studies/masters/master-innovation-and-research-informatics/masters-thesis.md)
    * [Information on the MAI master's thesis - 18 ECTS](en/studies/masters/master-artificial-intelligence/masters-thesis.md)
    * [Information on the MDS master's thesis - 30 ECTS](en/studies/masters/master-data-science/masters-thesis.md)

### 6\. Upload the required documentation to the platfom application

Before closing the application form upload the following documentation:

  * Language level certificate
  * Official transcript of records (issued by your university with all the courses finished up to now). If you are a Master's student, attach also your Bachelor's grades.
  * Curriculum Vitae
  * List of currently enrolled courses

### 7\. Application to be validated

Once your application is closed the coordinator of your institution will
receive an e-mail in order to validate the information you have provided in
the application form.

### 8\. Wait for an answer

Once the documentation is revised, we will send you an e-mail to inform you if
you have been accepted or not. Through the application form you will be able
to download your letter of admission and the Erasmus+ learning agreement, if
it is the case, duly signed and stamped.

### 9\. Register in the reception programmes

The Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya has two reception programs for
international exchange students: the Orientation Week and the Buddy Programme
Salsa'm.

The **Orientation Week (OW)** takes place during 2 days and includes an
institutional welcome, information on legal procedures, sessions with
information on the main services of the university which might help you during
your stay, a linguistic introductory workshop on Catalan language and culture,
as well as a visit to a museum in Barcelona and a sport activity.

There are several editions of the OW before classes begin. If you want to
attend any of the editions, you will have to register. Check all the
information in the website of the [UPC International
Relations](sri/en/students/students-mobility-office/orientation-week/upc-
orientation-week-english.md).

The **Buddy Programme Salsa'm** aims to welcome exchange students and help
them adapt to the university life in Barcelona. Each participant is assigned a
local student who provides academic, cultural and linguistic support. There
are also group activities such as guided tours, cultural outings and
international dinners.

It could be a great opportunity to meet new people, make friends, practice
languages and take the most out of your stay at FIB.

If you are interested in participation in this programme, fill in the
[form](slt/ca/formulari/international-students.md)

You can also see what has been done in this programme on
