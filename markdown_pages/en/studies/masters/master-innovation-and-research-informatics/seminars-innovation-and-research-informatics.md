Subtitle:

Introduction to Quantitative Linguistics

Dates:

Monday 03 March 2025 - Sunday 22 June 2025

Credits:

4.0

Description:

This course is an introduction to the statistical properties of languages and
their origins, that are often related to the need to reduce the cognitive
effort of speakers or listeners. The course is primarily relevant to anybody
interested in how languages (and animal communication) are and why. In this
course, students will learn about a myriad of statistical laws of language
beyond the scope of traditional courses on information retrieval, how to
analyze them and how to explain them based on general principles of (human)
cognition. Students will learn about the mathematical and computational models
that have been developed to explain these regularities. During this journey,
students will enrich their current knowledge with concepts and tools from
linguistics, biology, cognitive science, information theory and
multidisciplinary physics. The course is also relevant for researchers
interested in evaluating or adapting algorithms, machine learning
methods,...based on the real statistical properties of language. As these
regularities are often the result of reducing the cognitive effort of language
users, the course is also relevant to researchers interested in developing
resources or systems that are easier to use or understand by humans or in
developing natural language processing tools that exploit the real constraints
of the human brain. The webpage of the last edition of the course (to be
updated) is found here: https://cqllab.upc.edu/courses/iql/ Depending on the
number of participants, the professor may replace (upon approval by students)
the labs and the research project by a single research project to be developed
throughout the course. Important: to enrol in this course, please, email the
contact person.

Description:

The aim of this course is to provide students with knowledge and hands-on
experience in developing applications software for processors with massively
parallel computing resources. In general, we refer to a processor as massively
parallel if it has the ability to complete more than 64 arithmetic operations
per clock cycle. Many commercial offerings from NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel already
offer such levels of concurrency. Effectively programming these processors
will require in-depth knowledge about parallel programming principles, as well
as the parallelism models, communication models, and resource limitations of
these processors.

manner to the application developer in distributed computing platform. This is
achieved by annotating part of the codes as tasks, and building at execution a
task-dependence graph based on the actual data used consumed/produced by the
tasks. The COMPSs runtime is able to schedule the tasks in the computing nodes
and take into account facts like data locality and the different nature of the
computing nodes in case of heterogeneous platforms. Additionally, recently
COMPSs has been enhanced with the possibility of coordinating Web Services as
part of the applications. COMPSs supports Java, C/C++ and Python as
programming languages.

BSC is one of the community members that is contributing to the ecosystem.
This course is an opportunity to get familiar with technical aspects of the
standard through a combination of lectures and hands-on sessions. This course
identifies topics that are both fundamental to computer architecture and
relevant to the design of RISC-V based solutions of the future. The emphasis
is always on insights that will be useful to the (under)graduate student,
whether he/she goes on for a PhD or joins a software or hardware development
team. We will deal with principles, trade-offs, and implementation details
related to the RISC-V standard. Along the course, the students will get
familiar with some layers of the RISC-V software and hardware stacks using a
learning-by-doing methodology. This will provide a mechanism to the students
to understand the RISC-V ecosystem, BSC know-how and activities related to
RISC-V, and explore the potential of the ISA to freely develop new
technologies.. Topics will cover aspects like: how to boot an operating
system, how to deploy a container and execute an application, how to tune an
algorithm for improving its performance through the addition of custom
instructions, and finally, how to improve the performance of an HPC
application by taking advantage of the RISC-V Vector extension.

Description:

The objectives of this course are to understand the fundamental concepts
supporting message-passing and shared memory programming models. The course
covers the two widely used programming models: MPI for the distributed-memory
environments, and OpenMP for the shared-memory architectures. The course also
presents the main tools developed at BSC to get information and analyze the
execution of parallel applications, Paraver and Extrae. It also presents the
Parallware Assistant tool, which is able to automatically parallelize a large
number of program structures, and provide hints to the programmer with respect
to how to change the code to improve parallelization. It deals with debugging
alternatives, including the use of GDB and Totalview. The use of OpenMP in
conjunction with MPI to better exploit the shared-memory capabilities of
current compute nodes in clustered architectures is also considered. Paraver
will be used along the course as the tool to understand the behavior and
performance of parallelized codes. The course is taught using formal lectures
and practical/programming sessions to reinforce the key concepts and set up
the compilation/execution environment.
