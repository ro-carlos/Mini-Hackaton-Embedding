Description

Cybersecurity is becoming an increasingly important challenge for all
companies and individuals alike. While big names used to be the main targets
in the past, as people's lives move online, anyone is nowadays a potential
target for any kind of cyber-attack, ranging from phishing to ransomware or
serious privacy issues. In order to fight against those ever-evolving threats,
Machine Learning is increasingly being used behind the scenes to design better
systems that are able of self-learning to boost detection rates and boost
overall resilience to unknown attacks. As AI-based solutions penetrate
products across the industry, a new kind of threat that is often overlooked is
becoming more and more prominent and dangerous: adversarial machine learning
(AML).  
  
AML focuses on designing specific inputs to deceive a previously trained
Machine Learning models into misclassifying them for a specific purpose. One
of the main flaws of any state-of-the-art Machine Learning or Deep Learning
algorithms is that they assume that the nature of the data they receive is
systematically benign, which is generally the case but does not hold true when
an adversarial input is received. The motivation behind altering a ML model
into thinking that, for example, a new sample is benign when in fact is
malicious can range from pure research to more serious real-life issues such
as an autonomous car wrongly classifying a stop sign (and thus provoking a
fatal accident) or a wrongly diagnosed disease because of a slightly
manipulated magnetic resonance image.  
  
This problem is no exception for Cybersecurity where companies wrongly assume
that once the last AI-based product is deployed in their network, their
employees are safe...

Minimum requirements

We are particularly interested in candidates with minimal AI/ML background.
Previous experience in Cybersecurity will be also highly valued.

Description

Recent advancements in nanotechnology have enabled the development of means
for sensing and wireless communications with unprecedented miniaturization and
capabilities, to the point that they can be introduced into the
gastrointestinal tract inside a pill or into the bloodstream in the form of
passively flowing nanomachines.

This opens the door to the idea of intra-body communication networks, this is,
a swarm of nanosensors inside the human body that use communications to
coordinate their actions to sense and localize specific events (lack of
oxygen, biomarkers, etc). This can lead to the development of applications
such as continuous monitoring of diabetes, detection and localization of
cancer micro-tumors, or early detection of blood clots. These possibilities
are currently investigated by our team at the N3Cat (www.n3cat.upc.edu).

In this context, We are looking for excellent and self-motivated individuals
who are eager to develop ideas that will have a positive societal or socio-
economic impact. In particular, the students will work on ONE of the following
areas:

  * Developing means of zero-power communications between nanosensors inside the human body.
  * Designing protocols for communications from nanomachines inside the human body and implants or antennas in the skin surface.
  * Studying mobility inside the gastrointestinal tract and human bloodstream towards creating mobility models for accurate simulation of intra-body communications.
  * Dimensioning the system (inferring the required nanomachine density) to achieve a particular sensing goal/application.
  * Developing AI schemes for the localization of events inside of the human body.

Description

_GIS technology gives a wide-ranging support to environmental modeling,
especially to groundwater modeling. Numerous GIS applications have been
developed to define the hydrogeological conceptual model as well as the
numerical model. However, there is a scarcity of tools to implement the
conceptual model in numerical modeling platforms. This transition needs of
specific methodologies to adapt the geometries and alphanumerical data from
the conceptual model to the numerical model to get optimal numerical results.
Although most necessities can be satisfied with inherent GIS tools, there are
particular steps in the implementation of hydrogeological conceptual model
into the numerical modeling software that have not been automatized and put
together yet. They are mostly related to finite element mesh generation._

Traffic analysis is crucial for urban operations and planning, while the
availability of dense urban traffic data beyond loop detectors is still
scarce. A large-scale floating vehicle dataset of per-street segment traffic
information, _Metropolitan Segment Traffic Speeds from Massive Floating Car
Data in 10 Cities_(_MeTS-10_) is available for 10 global cities with a
15-minute resolution for collection periods ranging between 108 and 361 days
in 2019¿2021 and covering more than 1500 square kilometers per metropolitan
area. _MeTS-10_ enables novel, city-wide analysis of mobility and traffic
patterns for ten major world cities, overcoming current limitations of
spatially sparse vehicle detector data. _MeTS-10_ features traffic speed
information at all street levels from main arterials to local streets for
_Antwerp, Bangkok, Barcelona, Berlin, Chicago, Istanbul, London, Madrid,
Melbourne_ , and _Moscow_. The dataset leverages the industrial-scale floating
vehicle _Traffic4cast_ data with speeds and vehicle counts provided in a
privacy-preserving spatio-temporal aggregation. Data has to be map-matched to
the OpenStreetMap (OSM) road graph. City datasets can be compared with other
publicly available stationary vehicle detector data (for Berlin, London, and
Madrid) and the Uber traffic speed dataset (for Barcelona, Berlin, and
London). A comparison of the differences across some of the datasets in
spatio-temporal coverage and variations in the reported traffic will be
addressed in this project. The large spatial and temporal coverage offers an
opportunity for joining the _MeTS-10_ with other datasets, such as traffic
surveys in traffic planning studies or vehicle detector data in traffic
control settings. A pipeline is already available to derive the dataset from
the Traffic4cast data published by HERE. HERE is a technologal company
providing a platform for the visualization and analysis of location data. To
ensure data privacy, the Traffic4cast dataset was published as rasterized and
aggregated cell-based data, nevertheless providing a high spatial and temporal
resolution.

Computing systems are ubiquitous in our daily life and have transformed the
way we learn, work, or communicate with each other, to the point that progress
is intimately tied to the improvements brought by new generations of the
processors that lie at the heart of these systems.

A common trait of current computing systems is that their internal data
communication has become a fundamental bottleneck. Traditional interconnects
are insufficient and threatening to halt progress unless fast and versatile
communication alternatives are developed.

In the NaNoNetworking Center in Catalunya (N3Cat, www.n3cat.upc.edu), we
envisage a revolution in computer architecture enabled by the use of wireless
communications (and other unconventional interconnect technologies) inside
computer chips, both classical and quantum. Of course, this vision comes with
its own set of challenges since we need to figure out the best way to
architect these systems with the new capabilities of the interconnects. In
this direction, the candidate will work on one of the following areas:

  * Analysis of the communications workload in nowadays computer chips and development of network-on-chip architectures to serve such traffic optimally.
  * Development of chiplet-based architectures in the classical domain in cache-coherent based systems, delving into the cache coherence protocol and the interface with the wireless interconnect.
  * Development of a supercomputer-in-a-package, a chiplet-based architecture based on message passing, delving into how to speed up the MPI primitives with wireless communications.
  * Study of scalable quantum computing systems enabled by wireless classical communication across the chips of the quantum computer and inside a cryogenic refrigerator.

Description

This Master Thesis will take place at the Departament d'Arquitectura de
Computadors (DAC) in collaboration with the STAR group at the Barcelona
Supercomputing Center (BSC).

The System Tools and Advanced Runtimes (STAR) group at BSC focuses on research
crossing multiple software layers, from OS, runtimes, and low-level APIs, to
programming models, tools, and applications. We run traditional HPC, AI, and
Data Analytics applications on massively parallel HPC and Cloud platforms.

Machine learning (ML) has experienced a sustainable growth during the last
decade and more lately with the emergence of LLMs driven almost exclusively by
industry corporations. The size of such models is currently one of the major
limitations to deploy them on resource-constrained environments. CPU
manufacturers have begun introducing new hardware extensions such as VNNI and
AMX in order to accelerate mixed-precision calculations during ML training and
inference of low-bit precision LLMs.

The student will be tasked to quantise an already existing pretraining code
and measure the gains in performance as well as the potential issues like
accuracy losses. Next, he or she will optimize some of the most time-consuming
kernels by relying upon optimised third-party libraries. Two variants of
shared-memory parallelism will be explored in conjunction with distributed-
memory parallelism to benchmark the model and identify potential bottlenecks.
Finally, several LLMs will be analysed and compared.

The student will have the support from researchers within the STAR group,
which will provide them guidance throughout the duration of the thesis. The
GTP models will be evaluated using the computational resources of our group.

Minimum requirements

Basic knowledge of C/C++, OpenMP, and MPI.
