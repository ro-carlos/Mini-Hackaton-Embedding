## How to connect to IT resources

Before enrolling, you were sent a message with instructions on how to access
the e-Secretaria and UPC intranets. You can use the same username and password
to access the Racó and all others systems

__You’ll have access to the Racó and to your FIB email approximately 48 hours
after enrolling. Server accounts, rooms, etc. will be available from the first
day of class.

The way to connect depends on the computer or system you want to connect to:

  * **PC:** When you turn on a PC, you will be asked what system you want to work with: Windows or Linux. Select the desired option. After a moment, the selected system will appear on the screen and you will be asked to enter your username and password to connect.
  * **Database servers:** There are several database servers: MySQL, Postgres, Oracle, NoSQL and Hadoop. The servers you have access to will depend on the subjects you are enrolled in.
  * **Special operating system environment:** The specific way this environment works will be determined based on the design of practicals.

**More information at:**[Accounts on the PCs and servers](en/fib/it-
services/accounts-pcs-and-servers.md)****

__If you forget your password, you can change it
at[https://identitatdigital.upc.edu/gcredencials](gcredencials.md).

### Storage space

There is a common space for storing files for Windows and Linux systems. The
space allocated to each student is around 3 GB, and it can also be accessed
via the Web or from the Racó

**more information at:[Remote Access to the File Repository](en/fib/it-
services/remote-access-file-repository.md)**

### How do I connect remotely

We have summarized all the information that may be useful for you to study
from home. We explain [how you can work as if you were in FIB Computer
labs](en/fib/it-services/how-work-remotely-students.md).

### Accessing the Eduroam network

All students have access to the Eduroam network, which allows free access to
the internet inside the campus grounds, using the same username and password
as the rest of services offered by FIB. The Eduroam network can be accessed
using the same credentials from any other university or library in the world
that is also part of the Eduroam program. You can find more info on how to
connect to Eduroam in this guide
[https://serveistic.upc.edu/ca/wifiupc/documentacio/eduroam-configuration-
guide](ca/wifiupc/documentacio/eduroam-configuration-guide.md).

### VPN UPCLink

Some services, such as Aula Virtual, require the use of a VPN in order to be
accessed from your own home computer, laptop or smartphone. You can find a
guide to connect to the UPCLink VPN at
[https://serveistic.upc.edu/ca/upclink/documentacio/myupclink-configuration-
