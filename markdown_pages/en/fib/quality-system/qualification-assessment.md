The life cycle of a degree in the EHEA area is made up of a series of
evaluation processes: the initial **verification** , the **follow-up** of the
implementation, the introduction of possible **modifications** and the
**accreditation**. The degree supervision framework ([VSMA Framework for the
ex-ante assessment, monitoring, modification and
accreditation](en/universities/titulacions/vsma-framework.md)) of AQU (Catalan
University Quality Assurance Agency), and how the UPC has [implemented it in
its centres and degrees](seguimentdetitulacions/ca.md) is available to view.

In the particular case of FIB, these processes have been carried out
completely for the Bachelor Degree in Computer Engineering (GEI) and for the
three masters (MEI, MIRI, MAI). These three master's degrees and the GEI
represent the start of verified FIB degrees in the EHEA area (based on the
initial verification reports and the first [follow-up reports](en/fib/quality-
system/qualification-assessment.md)).

From 2016, the FIB also coordinates another master's degree (MSEC) that began
its cycle with a [verification report](en/fib/quality-system/qualification-
assessment.md) and a first accreditation report outside the FIB. Nevertheless,
the 2017 monitoring process and the re-accreditation during 2018-2019 is been
carried out under the FIB IQAS.

The Bachelor Degree in Data Science and Engineering (GCED) has begun its cycle
with the [initial verification report](en/fib/quality-system/qualification-
assessment.md) and its implementation during the academic year 2017-2018.

The current status of all FIB degrees can be viewed from this link, and the
access to their specific status is the [_Registro de Universidades, Centros y
Titulos_](ruct/home.md) (in English, “Register of Higher Education
Institutions and Degrees”). As for the outcomes and [seals of
AQU](en/universities/quality-labels-and-certificates.md), they are available
from the EUC portal. Concerning the historical outcomes of all degrees
reports, they can be viewed from EUC-reports.

## Validation (ex-ante assessment)

The Catalan University Quality Assurance Agency (AQU Catalunya) has full legal
authority and the technical expertise to issue ex-ante accreditation reports
for the validation of recognised degree courses in Catalonia.

Once a degree course has been validated, authorisation by the Government of
Catalonia (Generalitat de Catalunya) is necessary in order for it to be
introduced, in accordance with programming criteria and funding availability.
The final stage is official recognition by the Council of Ministers, following
which the degree is entered in the Register of Higher Education Institutions
and Degrees (RUCT).

## Monitoring

In accordance with the prevailing legal framework, registered degrees must be
monitored by a quality assurance agency, using the available public
information, until such time they are reviewed for the purposes of
accreditation renewal.

**Since the 2013-2014 academic year, the monitoring reports have been
integrated into the[FIB's annual reports](ca/la-fib/la-facultat/la-facultat-
en-xifres.md) (in Catalan).**

## Degree accreditation process

### Degree accreditation process during 2022-2023

In the [VSMA framework](seguimentdetitulacions/ca.md) for the quality of
university degree, GCED studies is in the process of renewing their
[accreditation](en/universities/titulacions/Accreditation.md).

A fundamental element of this procedure is the preparation of the
Accreditation Report by the centre. This report is the result of the work
carried out by the Internal Accreditation Panel, especially by the executive
members of the degree, the management teams and the administrative and service
staff responsible for the internal quality assurance system of the FIB, ETSETB
and FME.

The report must be public throughout the community, who will be able to send
their comments and proposals before the final approval to the governing bodies
of the School.

### Degree accreditation process during 2020-2021

In the [VSMA framework](seguimentdetitulacions/ca.md) for the quality of
university degrees, the GEI, MEI, MIRI and MAI studies are in the process of
renewing their [accreditation](en/universities/titulacions/Accreditation.md)
as well as the European [Euro-Inf](quality-label.md) quality labels.

A fundamental element of this procedure is the preparation of the
Accreditation Report by the centre. This report is the result of the work
carried out by the Internal Accreditation Panel, especially by the dean’s
staff and the administrative and service staff responsible for the internal
quality assurance system.

The report must be public throughout the community, who will be able to send
their comments and proposals before the final approval to the governing bodies
of the School.

Report](sites/fib/files/documents/fib/fib-upc-self-assessment-
report-2021-v1.pdf.md) of the GEI, MEI, MIRI and MAI degrees.

Degree accreditation process during 2018-2019

In 2018, a new accreditation process for the FIB relating to the mandatory re-
accreditation of the MSEC master's degree began. The [re-accreditation
report](sites/fib/files/documents/fib/2018_autoinforme_reacreditacio_msec_fib_octubre.pdf.md)
was made public, and was approved by the Standing Committee on 24 October
2018.

In 2019, the visit of the External Evaluation Committee (CAE) took place on
Friday 26 April. Its organisation and programme is available
[here](sites/fib/files/documents/composicio_i_agenda_cae_msec_0.pdf.md).

### Degree accreditation process during 2015-2016-2017

In 2015, the Bachelor Degree in Informatics Engineering (GEI) and three of the
master's degrees (MAI, MEI and MIRI) began the accreditation process with the
preparation of a self-report (SAR, Self-Assessment Report) approved by the
Faculty Board on 2 December 2015. The self-report concerned the accreditation
by AQU as well as the international accreditation of the [Euro-Inf
label](en/quality-management/accreditation-degree-programmes/quality-seals-
offered/euro-inf-label.html.md) through the [ASIIN](en/quality-
management/accreditation-degree-programmes/quality-seals-offered/euro-inf-
label.html.md) agency for the GEI, MEI and MIRI degrees. In the particular
case of MAI, it was decided to accredit an additional dimension of
internationalisation of AQU.

In May 2016, the External Evaluation Committee (EAC) came to visit. The
analysis of this committee (with representatives of both the Catalan quality
agency AQU and the German ASIIN) led to the final version of the self-report.
Between October and November, positive accreditation reports were received,
both from AQU (with mention of excellence for the GEI, MAI and MIRI) and from
[ASIIN](en/quality-management/accreditation-degree-programmes/quality-seals-
offered/euro-inf-label.html.md) ([factsheet and accreditation
report](pages/de/asiin/akkreditierung-studiengaenge/akkreditierte-
studiengaenge.php.md) of the [Euro-Inf label](en/quality-
management/accreditation-degree-programmes/quality-seals-offered/euro-inf-
label.html.md) at GEI, MEI and MIRI).

In May 2017, the visit of the External Evaluation Committee (EAC) took place
in order to evaluate the additional internationalisation dimension of MAI,
getting the accreditation of this dimension on 2 August 2017.

In 2017, the mandatory monitoring process of the MSEC master's degree was also
carried out.
